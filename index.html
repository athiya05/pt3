        <p>MANILA, Philippines — Eastern Samar has been placed under a state of calamity following endless rains and
            flooding whipped up by the shear line and low-pressure area (LPA).
        </p>
        <p>In a resolution signed Wednesday, November 22, members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Eastern Samar
            have declared a state of calamity in the province “due to incessant rainfall and massive flooding,
            caused by the shear line and low-pressure area in the eastern portion of the country.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The provincial board’s resolution also noted that the state of calamity declaration “is appropriate and
            proper to extend relief assistance to the affected families, providing them holistic support and to
            repair/rehabilitate the damage and affected areas.”
